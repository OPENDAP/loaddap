The automake build works and loaddap runs under RHEL3 on X86_64 and Mac OS/X
(both Panther and Tiger).

The software now installs in /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/share/loaddap; 
both of these must be on your matlabpath. Of course, you can change the prefix
/usr/local to another directory using ./configure --prefix=/another/place.

The --with-matlab option can be used to specify a particular version of
Matlab. Otherwise $MATLAB/bin must be on your PATH environment variable.
