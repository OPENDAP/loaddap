News for 3.6.0, 13 March 2008

Many changes, see the ChangeLog. Summary:WinXP build now works again;
Text/message output from loaddap now works (after Matlab 6 you had to use the
-nojvm option with Matlab to see the output); Issues with teh modern version
of writedap fixed.

News for 3.5.2

I fixed bug ### where large string variables/attributes cause the client to
fail.  This was caused by an incorrect use of the MAX_STR constant when the 
BIG_STR constant should have been used for allocating static character arrays.
Granted MAX_STR and BIG_STR aren't the best differentiating names but that's
what we're working with.

I updated the build scripts including the ones for Mac OS/X dmg and 
linux rpm. I've also added some information to the readme about bug 280
(http://scm.opendap.org:8090/trac/ticket/280). The problem is that Matlab
comes with an older copy of libgcc than newer Linux OS distributions. This
is documented on the Mathworks web site; see the README file.

I fixed bug 277 where loaddap and writedap don't communicate correctly
on 64-bit linux distributions.

I've started updating the in-Matlab tests for loaddap, although there are
still problems with the tests. The loaddap tool itself seems fine and the 
dejaGNU tests all work as expected.

Built OS/X packages. See INSTALL for information about targets in the
Makefile for OS/X package creation.

The automake build works and loaddap runs under RHEL3 on X86_64 and Mac OS/X
(both Panther and Tiger).

The software now installs in /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/share/loaddap; 
both of these must be on your matlabpath. Of course, you can change the prefix
/usr/local to another directory using ./configure --prefix=/another/place.

The --with-matlab option can be used to specify a particular version of
Matlab. Otherwise $MATLAB/bin must be on your PATH environment variable.
