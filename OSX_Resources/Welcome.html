<h2>About the OPeNDAP Matlab Command Package</h2>

<p>This package contains loaddap and whodap, two Matlab commands which
provide a way to access DAP data servers from Matlab. Using these, it
is possible to subset and read values from data servers all over the
Internet directly into Matlab. There's no need to worry about
converting file formats or first downloading the data.</p>

<p>By default, the software installs in 
<ul>
<li><tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> and </li>
<li><tt>/usr/local/share/loaddap</tt></li></ul>

To use the commands, add those directories to
your <tt>matlabpath</tt>. If you choose to install in a different
location you'll still need to make sure the destination directories are
on Matlab's path.</p>

<p>See the ReadMe file and online help for usage information.</p>
