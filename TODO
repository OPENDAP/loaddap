 * Remove String parameter from write_val

 X Merge functionality into Test Classes?

 * Structures, etc. in the Sequence type. General recursion for all types.

 * Add online help to loaddods.

 * Add a verbose option to loaddods.

 X Add a -m (Matlab 4) option to writeval that will print messages about
   variables (e.g., 3D arrays) that cannot be interned by Matlab 4.

 X Add a flag to writeval which will automatically scale values if a `scale
   factor' attribute is present.

 * Add a flag that will instruct writeval to `rename' a variable.

------------------------------ 2/3/97 ---------------------------------

 * Fix the no-pipes bug in startchild (see multi-load.m for code that
   exercises the bug). Fixed by replacing startchild() with popen(). 
   [closed 2/3/97 jhrg]

 * Fix: use of exit() by the loaddods command caused the entire Matlab
   executable to exit and left the shell messed up (had to use stty sane to
   get normal CLI operation back). I replaced all the exit() calls with
   return. 
   [closed 2/3/97 jhrg]

 * URLs with `.mat' in them (e.g., for datasets made up of .mat Matlab files)
   break loaddods because it thinks they are local loads and tries to read
   the URL as a local file. Fixed; now loaddods explicitly tests the last
   four chars of the filename/URL argument for `.mat'. URLs need at least a
   null CE (`?') appended to the URL.
   [closed 2/3/97 jhrg]

 * Add support for a version number/option. Done for both loaddods and
   writeval (use -V).
   [closed 2/3/97 jhrg]

 * Add a verbose flag to loaddods. Started a while ago - finished. (use -v).
   [closed 2/3/97 jhrg] 

 * Fix the `URL mess' that loaddods prints.
   [closed 2/4/97 jhrg]

 * Fix the -v option so that `-v' enables the default level of verbosity.
   Fixed by changing the way verbose is processed by writeval. The HTTP trace
   messages are now activated using -t and -v means verbose in the way a
   user would expect.
   [closed 2/4/97 jhrg]

 * Sometimes a variable from a previous URL is `kept around' from a previous
   invocation of loaddods and loaded again at the beginning of a command.
   This seems to happen with unconstrained URLs. Fixed by always initializing
   the command options string and other static/global string variables used
   to build up the writeval command.
   [closed 2/4/97 jhrg]

 * Write out NaN for string values that should translate to numbers, but don't
   for some reason. 
   [closed 2/5/97 jhrg]

 * Enlarge buffer loaddods uses. Enlarged to 8k.
   [closed 2/5/97 jhrg]

 * Make the output messages from loaddods nicer to look at and more
   informative. 
   [closed 2/5/97 jhrg]

 * loaddods starts writeval using an absolute path that reqires writeval be in
   the user's CWD.

 * loaddods/writeval combination fails for data transfers of Grids when the
   grid array contains 512^2 or greater items. The failure is a crash for
   512^2 transfers (and maybe others) and missing Map vectors for 1024^2
   transfers. This only happens on Solaris (not SGI, OSF or SunOS).
