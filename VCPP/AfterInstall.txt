Now that the loaddap binary has been installed, you will need to add its directory to Matlab's path using the addpath command. The default location for loaddap is C:\opendap\loaddap. However,  if you chose to put the software in a different location, use that path. Either way, you must add the path to loaddap once you start Matlab.

If you have questions about the addpath command, Try help addpath in Matlab our email us: support at opendap.org.
