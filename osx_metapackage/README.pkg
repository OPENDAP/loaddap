How to use this project to build an OSX meta-package which contains
the loaddap and libdap packages:

1. Place the libdap and loaddap packages in Contents/packages.

2. Set the toolbox name and version number in the Makefile.

3. Run 'make pkg'

4. Test the resulting DMG

5. Add the CPU type (INTEL or PPC) to the file name. This is typically
done right before the '.dmg' part of the file name (e.g., ....PPC.dmg).
