<h2>About the OPeNDAP Matlab Command Package</h2>

<p>This package contains loaddap and whodap, two Matlab commands which
provide a way to access DAP data servers from Matlab. Using these, it
is possible to subset and read values from data servers all over the
Internet directly into Matlab. There's no need to worry about
converting file formats or first downloading the data.</p>

<p>By default, the software installs in 
<ul>
<li><tt>/usr/local/bin</tt></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>To use the commands, add that directory to
your <tt>matlabpath</tt>. If you choose to install in a different
location you'll still need to make sure the destination directories are
on Matlab's path. The installer (which you're running now if you're
reading this) will let you choose another installation directory and
that should work just fine so long as that directory is on Matlab's
'matlabpath.'</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: You will need Matlab to 2007a or newer to run this
version of loaddap. We do not, however, test to see if Matlab is
present on your system before installing loaddap. That way you can
install the command and get Matlab later on.</p>

<p>See the README file and online help for usage information.</p>
